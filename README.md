### Greetings! ðŸ‘‹
I am a mechanical engineer by degree, minor in ECE, a C++ programmer by profession and a Roboticist by passion.
Currently developing my programming skills to be up-to-date with Industry standards. I like to deal with systems level software, knowing how things are operating on a low level basis. 
I wish to proceed my career in terms of advanced control systems and dynamics.
